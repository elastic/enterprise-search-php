[[authentication]]
=== Authentication

This section contains code snippets to show you how to connect to Enterprise Search, App Search, and Workplace Search.

Each service has its own authentication schemes. Enterprise Search uses a basic HTTP authentication with `username` and `password`.
App Search and Workplace Search also accept a `token`.
Refer to the authentication documentation for {app-search-ref}/authentication.html[App Search] and {workplace-search-ref}/workplace-search-api-authentication.html[Workplace Search] for the supported token types.

[[auth-ent]]
==== Authenticating with Enterprise Search

Enterprise Search supports HTTP basic authentication with a `username` and `password`.

You can specify the `enterprise-search` configuration in the `Client` initialization:

[source,php]
----------------------------
use Elastic\EnterpriseSearch\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'host' => 'https://id.ent-search.europe-west2.gcp.elastic-cloud.com',
    'enterprise-search' => [
        'username' => '<insert here the username>',
        'password' => '<insert here the password>'
    ]
]);

$enterpriseSearch = $client->enterpriseSearch();
----------------------------

Or pass directly the `username` and `password` in the `enterpriseSearch()` function:

[source,php]
----------------------------
use Elastic\EnterpriseSearch\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'host' => 'https://id.ent-search.europe-west2.gcp.elastic-cloud.com',
]);

$enterpriseSearch = $client->enterpriseSearch([
    'username' => '<insert here the username>',
    'password' => '<insert here the password>'
]);
----------------------------

[[auth-as]]
==== Authenticating with App Search

Follow the {app-search-ref}/authentication.html[App Search authentication guide] to find or create an App Search API key.

The API key is the `token` that you need to pass in the Client.

You can pass the `token` in the `Client` initialization:

[source,php]
----------------------------
use Elastic\EnterpriseSearch\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'host' => 'https://id.ent-search.europe-west2.gcp.elastic-cloud.com',
    'app-search' => [
        'token' => '<insert here the API key>'
    ]
]);

$appSearch = $client->appSearch();
----------------------------

Or pass directly the `token` in the `appSearch()` function:

[source,php]
----------------------------
use Elastic\EnterpriseSearch\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'host' => 'https://id.ent-search.europe-west2.gcp.elastic-cloud.com',
]);

$appSearch = $client->appSearch([ 'token' => '<insert here the API key>' ]);
----------------------------

[[auth-ws]]
==== Authenticating with Workplace Search

Workplace Search supports multiple authentication methods:

[discrete]
[[access-tokens]]
===== Workplace Search bearer tokens

Follow the {workplace-search-ref}/workplace-search-api-authentication.html[Workplace Search API authentication reference] to find or create a bearer token supported by Workplace Search.

You can pass the `token` in the `Client` initialization:

[source,php]
----------------------------
use Elastic\EnterpriseSearch\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'host' => 'https://id.ent-search.europe-west2.gcp.elastic-cloud.com',
    'workplace-search' => [
        'token' => '<insert here the access token>'
    ]
]);

$workplaceSearch = $client->workplaceSearch();
----------------------------

Or pass directly the `token` in the `workplaceSearch()` function:

[source,php]
----------------------------
use Elastic\EnterpriseSearch\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'host' => 'https://id.ent-search.europe-west2.gcp.elastic-cloud.com',
]);

$workplaceSearch = $client->workplaceSearch([ 'token' => '<insert here the access token>' ]);
----------------------------

[[elastic_cloud]]
=== Elastic Cloud

If you want to use https://www.elastic.co/cloud/[Elastic Cloud] you have many options
to configure the `enterprise-search-php` client.

The first settings is the `host` domain to connect. You can copy the endpoint URL
from the Deployment page of the Elastic cloud dashboard:

After, you need to choose the authentication mechanism for connecting to Enterprise
Search, App Search and Workplace Search.

[[auth-cloud-es]]
==== Authenticating with Enterprise Search in Cloud

You can use username (`elastic`) and password (the one given during the deployment).

[source,php]
----------------------------
use Elastic\EnterpriseSearch\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'host' => 'url/from/Elastic/Cloud/dashborad',
    'enterprise-search' => [
        'username' => 'elastic'
        'password' => 'the password from the deployment'
    ]
]);

$es = $client->enterpriseSearch();
----------------------------

Or you can use the API Key created in the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/api-keys.html#api-keys[Management > API Keys].

[source,php]
----------------------------
use Elastic\EnterpriseSearch\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'host' => 'url/from/Elastic/Cloud/dashborad',
    'enterprise-search' => [
        'apiKey' => 'the API Key from Management'
    ]
]);

$es = $client->enterpriseSearch();
----------------------------


[discrete]
[[auth-cloud-app]]
==== Authenticating with App Search in Cloud

For App Search you can use different authentication mechanisms:

- username and password, as for Enteprise Search;
- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/authentication.html#authentication-elasticsearch-tokens[Elasticsearch token];
- API key from the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/authentication.html#authentication-api-keys[App Search Credentials].

[source,php]
----------------------------
use Elastic\EnterpriseSearch\Client;

$client = new Client([
    'host' => 'url/from/Elastic/Cloud/dashborad',
    'app-search' => [
        'username' => 'elastic'
        'password' => 'the password from the deployment',
        // or
        'token' => 'token created from Elasticsearch get token API',
        // or
        'apiKey' => 'the API Key from App Search Credentials'
    ]
]);

$app = $client->appSearch();
----------------------------

[[auth-cloud-workplace]]
==== Authenticating with Workplace Search in Cloud

For Workplace Search you can use different authentication mechanisms:

- username and password, as for Enteprise Search;
- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/authentication.html#authentication-elasticsearch-tokens[Elasticsearch token];
- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/workplace-search/current/workplace-search-api-authentication.html#auth-token[Workplace Search API key]
- https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/workplace-search/current/workplace-search-api-authentication.html#oauth-token[Workplace Search OAuth token]

        'username' => 'elastic'
        'password' => 'the password from the deployment',
        // or
        'token' => 'token created from Elasticsearch get token API',

        'apiKey' => 'the API Key from Workplace Search API key'
        // or
        'apiKey' => 'the token from Workplace Search OAuth'
